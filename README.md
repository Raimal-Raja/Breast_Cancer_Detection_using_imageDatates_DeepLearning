## 📌 Project Overview

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Author** | Raimal Raja Kolhi |
| **Supervisor** | Assistant Professor Dileep Kumar |
| **Institution** | University of Sindh, Laar Campus |
| **Date** | 31 January 2026 |
| **Domain** | Medical Imaging & Computer Vision |

| **Architecture** | EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning) |
| **Test Accuracy** | 78.95% |
| **AUC Score** | 0.8552 |
| **Target Accuracy** | 90%+ (achievable with ~20 epochs) |

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Manual diagnosis of breast cancer from histopathology slides is **time-consuming**, **labor-intensive**, and **prone to human error**. Traditional pathology requires specialists to examine tissue samples under microscopes — a process subject to inter-observer variability. This project tackles that challenge by building an automated, consistent, and rapid diagnostic assistant that classifies tissue patches as **IDC Positive** or **IDC Negative**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
User uploads histopathology image
           ↓
Flask backend receives the image
           ↓
OpenCV preprocessing: resize → 96×96, BGR→RGB, normalize [0,1]
           ↓
Image passed to trained EfficientNetB0 model
           ↓
Sigmoid output → IDC probability & confidence score
           ↓
Result displayed instantly on the dashboard
```

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

```
EfficientNetB0 (pretrained on ImageNet)
           ↓
   Global Average Pooling
           ↓
   Batch Normalization
           ↓
     Dropout (0.5)
           ↓
      Dense Layer
           ↓
     Dropout (0.3)
           ↓
  Sigmoid Output → IDC Probability
```

EfficientNetB0 was selected for its excellent balance between model complexity and performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.10**
- GPU recommended for training — not required for inference / running the Flask app

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raimal-Raja/Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_imageDatates_DeepLearning.git
cd Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_imageDatates_DeepLearning/flask_app
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| **Windows** | `venv\Scripts\activate` |
| **macOS / Linux** | `source venv/bin/activate` |

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use the PowerShell script on Windows:

```powershell
.\requirements.ps1
```

### 4. Add the Trained Model Files

After training in Google Colab (see [Training](#-training-google-colab) below), copy the following files into `flask_app/models/`:

- `breast_cancer_model.keras`
- `model_config.pkl`

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## ☁️ Training (Google Colab)

The notebook `breast_cancer_colab_training.ipynb` handles the complete training pipeline.

### Kaggle API Setup

1. Create a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) account and go to **Settings → API**.
2. Generate a new token — Kaggle will download a `kaggle.json` file.
3. Upload `kaggle.json` to your Colab session.
4. The notebook uses the Kaggle API to automatically download the dataset — no manual downloading needed.

### Two-Phase Training Strategy

| Phase | Layers | Epochs | Description |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Base frozen | 6 | Only the custom classification head is trained |
| **Phase 2** | Last 30 layers unfrozen | Fine-tune | Reduced learning rate for deeper feature adaptation |

### Data Augmentation

`ImageDataGenerator` applies the following transforms to improve generalization and reduce overfitting:

- Random rotation
- Horizontal and vertical flips
- Random zoom

### Google Drive Storage

Trained outputs are automatically saved to Google Drive for persistence across Colab sessions:

| Google Drive Path | Contents |
|-------------------|----------|
| `/models/` | `best_model.keras`, `model_config.pkl` |
| `/results/` | Confusion matrices, training history plots |

---

## 📊 Results

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Test Accuracy** | 78.95% | Achieved with 6 epochs of training |
| **AUC Score** | 0.8552 | Strong discriminative ability between classes |
| **Target Accuracy** | 90%+ | Achievable by increasing training to ~20 epochs |

> The AUC score of 0.8552 confirms the model's strong ability to discriminate between IDC-positive and IDC-negative tissue samples, even at the initial training stage.

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | `GET` | Serves the main web dashboard |
| `/predict` | `POST` | Accepts an image file, returns IDC prediction as JSON |
| `/health` | `GET` | Returns model status and configuration info |

### `/predict` — Request

Send a `multipart/form-data` POST request with a `file` field containing the histopathology image.

### `/predict` — Response Example

```json
{
  "predicted_class": 1,
  "class_name": "IDC Positive",
  "confidence": 87.34,
  "probability_positive": 87.34,
  "probability_negative": 12.66,
  "image": "data:image/png;base64,..."
}
```
